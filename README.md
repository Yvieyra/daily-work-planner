## Description 

I have created an online daily work planner application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. Each hour of the day is categorized in colors depending on if the hour is in the future, current, or past. 

## Installation

There is no installation needed to access the quiz. It is available on the internet through the following link: https://yvieyra.github.io/daily-work-planner/

## Usage

The user can start by typing their tasks in the desired time block in which they plan on completing each task. The user will then hit the save button located on the right to save the typed task. The user can refresh the page without losing any typed text in the time blocks if they hit the save button.
